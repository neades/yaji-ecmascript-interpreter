   <title>gui package</title>
</head>
<body>
Defines the interface of the gui functions, so that they
can be implemented with AWT and Swing. Both the basicIO
functions and the functions used by the interpreter are defined.
<p>
Some functions may return an error with some implementation,
as not all implementations support all capabilities.
<p>
The implementation is select by loading dynamically the proper
guiFactory  as in
<pre>      
guiFactory = (GuiFactory) Class
              .forName("FESI.awtgui.AwtGuiFactory")
              .newInstance();
</pre>
Or by loading the BasicIOs or BasicIOw extension.
<p>
All other code should not refer directly to AWT or Swing classes,
to ensure that FESI can compile and be distributed with only one
of those classes.

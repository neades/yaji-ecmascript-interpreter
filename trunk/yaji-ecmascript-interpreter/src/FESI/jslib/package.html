Contains the public routines to access FESI
objects and functions. They are patterned after
Netscape 3.x functions and are largely upward
compatible with them (but greatly extended).
<p>The routines wrap the native FESI objects
and delegate the operations. This allow a better
independence of the implementation of FESI from
these routines, at the cost of some overhead.

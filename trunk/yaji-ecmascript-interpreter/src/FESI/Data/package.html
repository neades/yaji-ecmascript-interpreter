<p>The ESxxx contain internal or primitive objects.
<p>The other routines contains mostly standard objects.
<p>The objects are implemented by a xxxPrototype (which contains
the object specific functionality) and a xxxObject (which contains
the constructor).
<p>The ValueDescription is used to describe properties for the
debugging interface.
<p>The CompatibilityDescriptor is used to describe a native 
method. With ESLoader, ESWrapper and ESBean it provides support
for native routine access.

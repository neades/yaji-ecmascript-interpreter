Yet Another Javascript Interpreter

This project has been created to bring the FESI interpreter created by Jean-Marc Lugrin (http://www.lugrin.ch/fesi/) up to date so that it implements a good portion (if not all) the latest Ecmascript specifications.

We have created this fork as we are heavily dependent of FESI, it would be difficult for us to replace this with another interpreter such as Rhino. To be honest we would recommend you use Rhino unless you have a good  reason to use YAJI such as wanting to use LGPL rather than the dual licensing of Rhino (or you  just fancy writing interpreters!).

As development of FESI appears to have ceased (the last release was 29-Sep-2003), the best way for us to bring our core engine up to date was to do it ourselves, and as the code is LGPL, the best way of doing that was to create this Open Source project.

To get us started there is a list of CurrentTasks and some notes on DevelopingYaji
